# DiffEntro

DiffEntro is an entropy-guided differential testing framework that bridges the work of the AI ​​and SE communities and enhances the robust generalization of defensible models.

## 0x01 Prerequisite
The project is developed based on Python 3.7 and Tensorflow 2.2.0, conda is recommended for enviroment isolation.

```bash
conda create -n py37-tf2-gpu python=3.7
conda activate py37-tf2-gpu
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## 0x02 Train Models
Enter the folder of the corresponding dataset to train the models to be tested.

Take training LeNet4 under MNIST as an example.
```bash
cd MNIST
python train_models.py -m lenet4
```
Then the model is saved as *LeNet4_MNIST.h5*, following the naming rule as *{model_name}_{dataset}.h5*.

Next, the pre adversarial trained model for differential testing should be obtained.
```bash
mkdir checkpoint
python std_adv_train.py
```
*LeNet4_MNIST_Adv_12000.h5* in the checkpoint folder is the pre adversarial trained model, following the naming rule as *{model_name}_{dataset}\_Adv\_{advSample}.h5*.

## 0x03 Start Testing
Before we start testing, the config.ini should be configured.
```bash
cd diff_fuzz
vim config.ini
```
```ini
[model]
name = LeNet4
dataset = MNIST
advSample = 12000
```
Now you are all set to start testing.
```bash
python fuzzing.py
```
